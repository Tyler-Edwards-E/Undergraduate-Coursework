# SAS-Linear-Regression
My SAS code for a part course project

The goal of this project was to determine predictors for the variable PS_HAM27. 

Our group's method for creating a model was for each of us to create an original model for PS_HAM27 using our respective methods and perspectives. Then we created a final model using the similarities our personal models had.
